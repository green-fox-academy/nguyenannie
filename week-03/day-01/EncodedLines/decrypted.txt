The Zen of Python
by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases arenat special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguityf refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be onegg and preferably only one ggobvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless youare Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than drightd now.
If the implementation is hard to explainf itas a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explainf it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea gg letas do more of those[
